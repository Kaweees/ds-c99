Data structures written in C99.

I tend to be pedantic about how I write code. Here is how I name my variables:

```c
/* Preprocessor directives are in all caps delimited by underscores */
MY_DEFINE
/* Types are in capital case */
MyType
/* Functions are in camel case */
myFunction()
/* variables are in snake case */
my_variable
```
